<p>The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is a mathematical Olympiad
for pre-college students, and is the oldest of the International Science
Olympiads. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held
annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries, representing over 90% of
the world&#39;s population, send teams of up to six students, plus one team
leader, one deputy leader, and observers.</p>
