<p>A Bristol academic has achieved
a milestone in
statistical/mathematical physics
by solving a 100-year-old
physics problem—the discrete
diffusion equation in finite
space.</p>

<p>The long-sought-after solution could be used to accurately
predict encounter and transmission probability between
individuals in a closed environment, without the need for time-
consuming computer simulations.</p>

<p>In his paper, published in Physical Review X, Dr. Luca Giuggioli
from the Department of Engineering Mathematics at the
University of Bristol describes how to analytically calculate the
probability of occupation (in discrete time and discrete space)
of a diffusing particle or entity in a confined space—something
that until now was only possible computationally.</p>

<p>Dr. Giuggioli said: "The diffusion equation models random
movement and is one of the fundamental equations of physics.
The analytic solution of the diffusion equation in finite domains,
when time and space is continuous, has been known for a long
time."</p>

<p>"However, to compare model predictions with empirical
observations, one needs to study the diffusion equation in
finite space. Despite the work of illustrious scientists such as
Smoluchowski, Pólya, and other investigators of yore, this has
remained an outstanding problem for over a century—until
now."</p>

<p>&quot;Excitingly, the discovery of this exact analytic solution allows
us to tackle problems that were almost impossible in the past
because of the prohibitive computational costs.&quot;</p>

<p>The finding has far-reaching implications across a range of
disciplines and possible applications include predicting
molecules diffusing inside cells, bacteria roaming in a Petri dish,
animals foraging within their home ranges, or robots searching
in a disaster area.</p>

<p>It could even be used to predict how a pathogen is transmitted
in a crowd between individuals.</p>

<p>Solving the conundrum involved the joint use of two
techniques: special mathematical functions known as
Chebyshev polynomials, and a technique invented to tackle
electrostatic problems, the so-called method of images.</p>

<p>This approach allowed Dr. Giuggioli to construct hierarchically
the solution to the discrete diffusion equation in higher
dimension from the one in lower dimensions.</p>
