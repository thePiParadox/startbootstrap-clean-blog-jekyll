<p>Mathematical modelling lives a varied life. It links the grey squirrel invasion in the UK to the analysis of how tumour cells invade the body; Alan Turing's model for pattern formation gives insight into animal coat markings and Premier League Football Shirts; and models for Excitability have been used to model the life cycle of the cellular slime mold and heart attacks.

  Philip Maini will reveal all in our latest Oxford Mathematics Public Lecture.</p>

<p>Philip K. Maini received his B.A. in mathematics from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1982 and his DPhil in 1985 under the supervision of Prof J.D. Murray, FRS. He spent a year teaching at Eton College before returning to Oxford in 1987 as a postdoc at the WCMB and a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College.
His present research projects include the modelling of avascular and vascular tumors, normal and abnormal wound healing, and a number of applications of               mathematical modelling in pattern formation in early development, as well as the theoretical analysis of the mathematical models that arise in all these applications.
