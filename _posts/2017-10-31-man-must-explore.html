<p>The Unicus Mathematics Olympiad (UMO) is an international competitive exam held online as well as offline (pen/paper) for students in classes 1-11 (year 2020-21). 
   Since various Olympiads are based on curriculum which doesn’t get complete on time, Unicus Olympiads provide a great platform to assess student’s practical application based on the concepts they have studied. 
   Students will be provided with three Mock Tests to practice before the Final Exam. The Mock Tests can be attempted for 3 times. The exam will be a MCQ-type test. The students of classes 2 to 11 need to complete the test in 60 minutes while students of class 1 need to complete in 45 minutes.</p>
