<p>The Unicus Mathematics Olympiad (UMO) is an international competitive exam held online as well as offline (pen/paper) for students in classes 1-11 (year 2020-21). 
   Since various Olympiads are based on curriculum which doesn’t get complete on time, Unicus Olympiads provide a great platform to assess student’s practical application based on the concepts they have studied. 
   Students will be provided with three Mock Tests to practice before the Final Exam. The Mock Tests can be attempted for 3 times. The exam will be a MCQ-type test. The students of classes 2 to 11 need to complete the test in 60 minutes while students of class 1 need to complete in 45 minutes.</p>

<h3>Basic Structure</h3>
<p>The exam consists of two sections-
Classic Section: This section will consist of questions related to practical applications of Mathematics
  Scholar Section: This section will have questions on High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
